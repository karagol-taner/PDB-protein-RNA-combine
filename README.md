# PDB-protein-RNA-combine
This Python script combines a protein PDB file and an RNA PDB file into a single PDB file with specified chain IDs for each molecule. This combined PDB file is useful for docking studies those performed with RosettaDock. The protein is assigned chain ID `A`, and the RNA is assigned chain ID `B`.


## Usage

1. Download the `PDB-protein-RNA-combine.py` script.

2. Run the script using Python.

3. Alternatively, you can run the script in Google Colab using the following notebook:
